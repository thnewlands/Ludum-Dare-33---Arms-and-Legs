Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

Push the branch on github :
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]

When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch.

You can see all branches created by using :
$ git branch

Which will show :

* approval_messages
  master
  master_clean

Push changes from your commit into your branch :
$ git push origin
(this will prob cause error, so instead use this:
$ git push --set-upstream origin [name_of_branch_to_push] )

Then you need to apply to merge changes, if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do :
$ git merge origin/develop

Delete a branch on your local filesystem :
$ git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]

To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem :
$ git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]

Delete the branch on github :
$ git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]
